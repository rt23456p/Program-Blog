I tested out some random looping on the replacing, so that random replacing can take place in JilanSolution, which I mentioned yesterday, which makes the text more variable and no longer fixed and boring, which you can see below as an example test code

<br/>


                        ```python

                        code = "tesla , tesla , tesla "

                        while 'tesla' in code:
                            K = random.randint(1,2)
                            if K == 1:
                                code = code.replace('tesla', 'BMW',1)
                            if K == 2:
                                code = code.replace('tesla', 'porsche',1)
                        print(code)

                        Output Run 1:

                          Work Done:

                          BMW , BMW , porsche
                          [Finished in 0.056s]

                        Output Run 2:

                          Work Done:

                          porsche , porsche , porsche
                          [Finished in 0.077s]
                        ```
                        <br/>



I am very excited about this new test run that is successful and Hopefully the development can be finished by early next month, the expected of the first usable version currently is 75 Days, but is subjected to change.

*19,Aug,2020* (On the topic of latest research and development of functions)

I am currently writing a function which enables replacing certain words with another one with the same meaning to beat the anti plagiarism system such as Turnitin, I probably will going to open-source it once I am finished with it to help student out there that don't have the time to paraphrase school assignment from the internet, I think the software development will going to take around 60-120 days to come out with a good enough to use version, DM me at rt23456p@yandex.com if you want to help me with word replacing related once since Lan&Lit is one of my worst subject and my least favourite subject for sure. 
You can view the code once I public it at https://github.com/rt23456p/JilanSolution.
