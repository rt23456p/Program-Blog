<br/>

After mentioning pyinstaller in last post, I have been researching other ways of packing to be more friendly for people that don't know code, more info on the next post.



*23,Aug,2020* (On Some Experiment)
<br/>

Today, I tested out mutiple way of packing python into .exe files, which will be useful in the JilanSolution for people that don't know code, but there is still some issues that I need to fixed later, you can see the test build in JilanSolution repo.

*20,Aug,2020* (On Some Experiment)

I tested out some random looping on the replacing, so that random replacing can take place in JilanSolution, which I mentioned yesterday, which makes the text more variable and no longer fixed and boring, which you can see below as an example test code

<br/>

```python
code = "tesla , tesla , tesla "
while 'tesla' in code:
K = random.randint(1,2)
if K == 1:
  code = code.replace('tesla', 'BMW',1)
if K == 2:
  code = code.replace('tesla', 'porsche',1)
print(code)
```


And the outputs:
```python

Run 1:

BMW , BMW , porsche
[Finished in 0.056s]

Run 2:

porsche , porsche , porsche
[Finished in 0.077s]
```
<br/>



I am very excited about this new test run that is successful and Hopefully the development can be finished by early next month, the expected of the first usable version currently is 75 Days, but is subjected to change.

*19,Aug,2020* (On the topic of latest research and development of functions)

I am currently writing a function which enables replacing certain words with another one with the same meaning to beat the anti plagiarism system such as Turnitin, I probably will going to open-source it once I am finished with it to help student out there that don't have the time to paraphrase school assignment from the internet, I think the software development will going to take around 60-120 days to come out with a good enough to use version, DM me at rt23456p@yandex.com if you want to help me with word replacing related once since Lan&Lit is one of my worst subject and my least favourite subject for sure. 
You can view the code once I public it at https://github.com/rt23456p/JilanSolution.
